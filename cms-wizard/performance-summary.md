## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Optimize Click Feedback**
   - Reduce button animation duration from 378ms to <250ms
   - Consider using CSS transforms instead of JavaScript animations
   - Enable hardware acceleration with will-change CSS property

2. **Improve Skeleton Screen Performance**
   - Reduce skeleton display time from 1530ms to <500ms
   - Simplify skeleton animation or remove unnecessary complexity
   - Consider showing content progressively instead of waiting for full load

3. **Continue Monitoring**
   - The majority of animations (5/7) are performing excellently
   - Overall application performance is strong with 60+ FPS
   - Memory usage is very efficient at 4.25MB
   - Continue performance monitoring as new features are added

## Overall Assessment: **Good Performance** 📊

The CMS Wizard application demonstrates strong animation performance with excellent FPS rates and smooth transitions. Two areas need optimization but do not significantly impact the overall user experience. The application maintains 60 FPS for core animations and uses memory efficiently.
